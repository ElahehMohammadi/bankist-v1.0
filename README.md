# bankist-v1.0

🎉 Welcome to the Bankist First Simple Ver project, a collaborative effort to create a basic web application that mimics fundamental banking functionalities. 🎉

🛠️ In collaboration with my teacher, Jonas Schmidtmann, who developed the HTML and CSS components, I contributed to the JavaScript functionality of this project, utilizing my newfound knowledge of arrays to enhance the application's data management capabilities. 🧑‍💻
